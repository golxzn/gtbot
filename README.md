## __*DEPENDENCIES*__

 - OpenSSL;
 - zlib;

## __*BUILD PROJECT*__

I actually use `CMake`, `MSVC`, `Ninja` and `clang` for build __tbot__. You need to have network connection
to build this project, because the CMake scripts use it to download dependencies and tools.

Read more about building the project [here][docs_build_project].

## __*PROJECT STRUCTURE*__

You could get acquainted with the project structure [here][docs_project_structure].
